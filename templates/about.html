        <h2>here's what you need to know:</h2>
        <p>I'm yuli, a woman and a lynx. I've been through a lot, but still I have an ocean of tenderness, an abyss of sorrowful hope, a cosmos of love towards this world. the blog you've stumbled across is my special place where I weave this all into words of a language that is not my native, but the one I now speak the most. you can find here: poetry, birth and postpartum doula musings, fertility awareness educator rants, reviews on books and videogames, esseys on mytghology and coding, passionate takes on recent research regarding women's health, stories of owning a business and closing a business, of becoming a war refugee, of discovering neurodivergence, of community interpreting and working in a health store, of coping with depression and anxiety, of marriage and divorce, of finding love when your heart is broken and your mind is shattered and your sence of self is almost erased, of raising three kids, of walking with cats and living on a mountain in the West of Ireland. and maybe something more.</p>
